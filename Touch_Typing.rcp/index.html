            Why is it important to learn keyboarding?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It frees up cognitive energy so you focus on the ideas instead of just the language required to
                articulate
                them. Moreover, learning keyboarding improves accuracy and can help with decoding and sight-reading
                skills
                for children and adults who struggle with specific learning difficulties.
            </li>
            <li> To complete your work faster it is important to develop typing skills. Typing helps you to work
                comfortably
                on the computer, it aids in communicating with colleagues and customers, creating documents, and finding
                new
                information.</li>

                        This web application will help you to learn touch typing which means typing through muscle
                        memory without using your eyesight to find the keys. It can improve your typing speed and
                        accuracy dramatically

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No boring repetitive exercises. Unlike most other typing tutors, this application does not force
                        you to repeat the same lessons like ‘jjf jjk jjf jjk’ over and over again. This is very annoying
                        and contributes very little to your overall learning.
                    </li>
                    <li>This application uses a sophisticated computer algorithm to generate typing lessons that match
                        your skill level. These lessons consist of random words generated using a subset of the full
                        alphabet of letters. The size of the subset and individual letter frequency is controlled by the
                        algorithm, which provides you with the best learning experience.
                    </li>
                    <li>When the algorithm includes a new letter to the current subset, the frequency of this letter is
                        artificially boosted so that it will be included in every generated word of a lesson.

                        The algorithm can also artificially rearrange letter frequencies, placing an emphasis on the
                        letters with the worst time-to-type metric.

                        This means you will always be typing the letters that you are least familiar with.

                        An average professional typist types usually in speed of 65 to 75 WPM. More advanced positions
                        require 80 to 95 ( usaually the minimum required for dispatch positions and other time-sensitive
                        typing jobs). There are also some advanced typists and work that requires speeds above 120 WPM.

            Here are three tips to keep you up to speed on your keyboard skills.</h3>

            1.) Use the correct starting position</h4>
        <img src="asdfjkl;.png" class="img-2" alt="asdfjkl;-postion">
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                While there are plenty of people who can type quickly with just two fingers, typing with all ten fingers
                dramatically increases your accuracy and speed.
                Your keyboard is made up of 101 different keys. If you type in a way that each finger is responsible for
                specific keys, your fingers move as little as possible. You conserve energy, build muscle memory, and
                type faster.
            </li>
            <li>
                When practicing your typing skills, it’s important to use proper hand placement. To start, keep your
                fingers
                positioned over the home row keys (left hand over the A, S, D, and F keys, and the right hand over
                the J, K,
                L, and ; keys), with your thumbs hovering over the space bar. From here, you can move your fingers
                slightly
                to reach neighboring keys. Your hands should always return this starting position.
            </li>
            <li>
                These conventions are meant to help you familiarize yourself with the keyboard. As you become more
                experienced, you can experiment with different variations of this starting position to find the
                placement
                that is most comfortable and natural for you.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4
            style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">
            2.) Maintain good posture</h4>
        <img src="postion.jpg" class="img-2" alt="sitting-postion">

        <p>
            Though you might expect manual labor to be more trying on your body, for some, extensive sitting and
            keyboard work can be even more damaging. That is why having proper posture in front of your computer is key.
            So what does proper typing posture look like?
        <ul>
            <li>
                Sit up straight with your feet flat on the floor. Be careful to avoid crossing your legs under you or
                propping them up under your desk.
            </li>
            <li>
                You want your elbows to have a 90-degree angle with your arms close to your side. Adjust your chair
                height if you find your shoulders hunching.
            </li>

                Fingers should be curved over the keyboard with your thumbs near the space bar. Avoid resting your
                wrists on the computer while typing, using the wrist pad for breaks only.

                And finally keep your head and neck facing your screen. If you are using two screens, try to avoid
                excessively turning and tilting.

                Nothing is mastered overnight, and in order to really improve your typing accuracy and speed, you need
                to practice every day.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are many websites(as I menstioned above) that offer free typing skills tests and practice.

                It’s important to take your time with these typing exercises and assessments. Attempting to rush through
                them will only result in more errors at first. Trust that your speed will improve naturally as you
                become more familiar with the keyboard.
            </li>
            <li>
                Improving your typing skills will not only make your student life much easier, it will benefit you in
                your future career as well. It might take a lot of practice to see improvement, but don’t give up.
                You’ll be typing like a pro in no time!

                Your fingers learn where each key is placed and are able to find them without assistance from your eyes.
                Once you can find each key without looking at the keyboard, you'll find your typing speed increases
                exponentially, and the more you practice, the faster you will get.
